## AI-Powered Personal Assistant in Java

This Java program serves as a basic AI-powered personal assistant capable of recognizing and responding to simple commands. It utilizes the Java Speech API for speech recognition and basic command parsing.

### Functionality

- **Greetings**: Responds to greetings like "hello" or "hi".
- **Time**: Provides the current time upon request.
- **Date**: Provides today's date upon request.
- **Gratitude**: Responds to expressions of gratitude like "thank you" or "thanks".
- **Exit**: Allows the user to exit the program.

### Usage

1. Compile the Java code using a Java compiler.
2. Run the compiled program.
3. Speak or type commands and interact with the personal assistant.

### Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
- Java Speech API (included in JDK).

### Example Interaction

```
Hello! How can I assist you today?
> What's the time?
The current time is: 12:00 PM
> Thanks!
You're welcome!
> Goodbye!
Goodbye! Have a great day!

```

### Note

This is a simplified version of an AI-powered personal assistant and lacks the advanced features found in commercial assistants like Siri or Alexa. For a more sophisticated assistant, additional functionality and integration with external services and APIs would be required.
